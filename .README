# TraxStax 

## MVP

The Traxstax site is a community in which users can keep track of the songs they're playing at the moment in the form of tracklists, to enable this the _User_ will be able to:

* Create a new _Tracklist_.
* Add a _Song_ to the _Tracklist_.
* Remove a _Song_ from the _Tracklist_.
* Delete a _Tracklist_.
* Add a _Song_ to the database.


## Possible Extensions

Once the basic functionality of the app is achieved, possible enhancements include:

* Enable _Users_ to follow eachothers _Tracklists_.
    * This will assign the _Tracklist_ to the _User_ but the user will not be able to edit the _Tracklist_.
* Emable _Users_ to delete a _Song_ from the database if their id is the user_id associated with the _Song_.
* Include a comments section at the bottom of each _Tracklist_ in which _User_ can discuss what they think of the songs.
